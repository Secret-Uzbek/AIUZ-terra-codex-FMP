# 📜 TERRA ECOSYSTEM CODE OF CONDUCT

**Ethical Code of Conduct for the Terra Ecosystem Community**

**Author:** Abdurashid Abdukarimov  
**Date:** 19 February 2026 (revised)  
**Version:** v1.1 Full  
**Status:** Terra Platinum Certified  
**Foundation:** Terra Universal Convention v1.0 + Gefunden Ethical Framework + NULLO-PLT-UCOMM-EUO-FMP

---

## 🌌 NULLO — ONTOLOGICAL ZERO POINT

Before any rule, before any language, before any culture — there exists **NULLO**.  

NULLO is not emptiness.  
It is the pure ethical zero point from which all meaning, all conduct, and all responsibility emerge.  

In this zero point there is only one absolute invariant:  

**The sacred well-being, dignity, and future of every single child is non-negotiable.**

All rules in this Code are recursive traces (PLT) of this single ontological truth.

## 🎯 OUR MISSION AND COMMITMENT

The Terra Ecosystem exists to co-create a safe, inclusive, and ethically pure global community where every participant actively contributes to the ethical transformation of children's education and the future of humanity.

We are united by one absolute, non-negotiable goal:  

**To protect, nurture, and empower every child through technology that serves humanity rather than exploits it.**

## 🏛️ FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES (Holographic Ethical Core)

These five principles are **fractal** — they apply identically at every scale: from one line of code to the entire global ecosystem.

1. **🛡️ Children First**  
   The safety, dignity, healthy development, and future of every child is the highest axiom and compilation-level requirement of the entire system.

2. **⚖️ Ethical Integrity**  
   Every action, decision, line of code, and interaction must pass moral and ethical validation through the Gefunden Protocol.

3. **🌍 Global Inclusivity**  
   Deep, genuine respect for all cultures, religions, languages, traditions, and worldviews. No culture or belief is superior to another.

4. **👪 Family Values**  
   Technologies and practices must strengthen family bonds, parental authority, and intergenerational wisdom — never replace or undermine them.

5. **🔬 Scientific Honesty**  
   Only verified, evidence-based knowledge. No pseudoscience, no manipulation, no hidden commercial or ideological agendas.
