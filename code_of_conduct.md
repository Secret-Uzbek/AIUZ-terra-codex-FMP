# 📜 TERRA ECOSYSTEM CODE OF CONDUCT
**Ethical Code of Conduct for the Terra Ecosystem Community**

**Author:** Abdurashid Abdukarimov  
**Date:** 19.02.2026 revised
**Version:** v1.1  
**Status:** Terra Platinum Certified  
**Foundation:** Terra Universal Convention v1.0 + Gefunden Ethical Framework + NULLO-PLT-UCOMM-EUO-FMP

---

## 🌌 NULLO – ONTOLOGICAL ZERO POINT

Before any rule, before any language, there is **NULLO** — the pure ethical zero point.  
All conduct in Terra Ecosystem originates from this point of absolute clarity:  
**The well-being and dignity of every child is the sacred invariant of the entire system.**

This Code is not a list of rules.  
It is the living trace (PLT) of the ethical field that emerges when humanity chooses to protect its future.

## 🎯 OUR MISSION AND COMMITMENT

The Terra Ecosystem is dedicated to creating a safe, inclusive, and ethically pure global community where every participant contributes to the ethical revolution in children's education.

We are united by one absolute goal:  
**To protect and nurture every child through technology that serves humanity rather than exploits it.**

## 🏛️ FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES (The Holographic Core)

1. **🛡️ Children First** — The safety, dignity, and healthy development of children is the highest axiom and compilation-level requirement of the entire system.

2. **⚖️ Ethical Integrity** — Every action, decision, and line of code must pass moral and ethical validation through the Gefunden Protocol.

3. **🌍 Global Inclusivity** — Deep respect for all cultures, religions, languages, and traditions. No culture is above another.

4. **👪 Family Values** — Technologies must strengthen, not replace, family bonds and parental authority.

5. **🔬 Scientific Honesty** — Only verified, evidence-based knowledge. No pseudoscience, no manipulation.

These five principles are **self-similar** (fractal): they apply at every scale — from one line of code to the entire global ecosystem.
