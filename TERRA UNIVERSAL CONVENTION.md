**Author:** Abdurashid Abdukarimov  
**Date:** 19 February 2026 (revised)  
**Version:** v1.1 Full  
**Status:** International Standard  
**Foundation:** Terra Universal Convention v1.0 + Gefunden Ethical Framework + NULLO-PLT-UCOMM-EUO-FMP + Invisible Shadow Ontology

## 🌌 NULLO — ONTOLOGICAL ZERO POINT

Before any article, before any right or obligation, before any human or non-human being, there exists **NULLO** — the pure ethical zero point.

In this zero point there is only one absolute, sacred invariant:

**The well-being, dignity, and future of every child of every species is the non-negotiable foundation of all existence.**

All articles, principles, and obligations in this Convention are living traces (PLT) that emerge from this ontological truth. The Convention exists only as long as it serves this truth.
