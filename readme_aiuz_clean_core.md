# AIUZ Ecosystem — CleanCore v2

> Semantic Civic Architecture for Open Knowledge Societies

---

## 🌍 Overview
AIUZ (Architectural Interface for Universal Zonation) is a civic-societal framework designed to organize, empower, and semantically connect decentralized knowledge systems.

**CleanCore v2** is the distilled, modular, and fully textual version of the AIUZ ecosystem, structured for clarity, shareability, and civic use.

---

## 📦 Structure
The core archive includes:

- `/L0–L5/` — Semantic layers from origin to distributed systems
- `/codex/` — Codex Terra, microcore ontology, and semantic injection formats
- `/trace/` — System memory and lineage logic (Σ-core)
- `/meta/` — Session logs, validation protocols, and comparative analytics
- `/education/` — AIUZ LiveClass immersive pedagogy system
- `/grant/`, `/un/`, `/tasmu/` — Civic and institutional modules
- `/kernel/` — Ethical Layer, DAO logic, GlobalKnowledgeDB, Semantic Kernel
- `/os/` — Terra OS architecture, tokenization, UX, interface components

Full structure documented in: `file_index.md`

## 🧠 Philosophy
AIUZ follows the path **from the quark to the multiverse**:

- 🔹 Minimal barriers, maximum clarity
- 🔹 Machine-readable, human-aligned
- 🔹 Resilient by decentralization
- 🔹 Ethics and semantics first

This repository is intentionally built without proprietary formats: all files are `.md`, `.txt`, `.yaml`, `.json` — usable on any device.

---

## ✅ How to use
1. **Explore the layers** in `file_index.md` or start from `mission_manifest.md`
2. Use `/codex/` + `/kernel/` as the logic layer
3. Adapt `/education/` and `/ui/` for civic engagement
4. Share or fork this repo to contribute semantic modules
