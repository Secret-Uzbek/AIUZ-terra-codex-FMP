AB  - A recent meeting focused on accelerated materials design and discovery
examined user requirements for a general, collaborative, integrative,
and on-demand materials research platform. A recent meeting focused on
accelerated materials design and discovery examined user requirements
for a general, collaborative, integrative, and on-demand materials
research platform. What common elements are necessary to create a
general framework for materials innovation? Here, we provide a
retrospective analysis of high-level themes that emerged from a
focused discussion on the requirements for a future materials research
platform. These discussions occurred during the annual Toyota Research
Institute—Accelerated Materials Design and Discovery meeting (May 29,
2019, in Boston, MA) with more than 40 field experts from
universities, US national laboratories, Toyota Research Institute in
the United States, and Toyota Motor Corporation in Japan. These
researchers contributed ideas toward what capabilities such a platform
should have to accelerate the design and discovery of materials. To
maximize the information captured from these field experts' ideas, we
followed a strategy comprised of exploitation and exploration inspired
by knowledge acquisition strategies in machine learning. In a first
session, we matched researchers with themes that we expect them to be
knowledgeable about (hence exploitation). In a follow-up session, we
did a quasi-random assignment of researchers to themes (hence
exploration), with the goal of capturing unique ideas that might elude
experts embedded deep in their work. Sixteen pre-selected themes
relevant for a materials research platform were discussed twice in two
unique groups, one formed as an exploitation and the other formed as
an exploration team. The selected themes were: Adaptive
systems—active-learning and beyond; Automation of experiments;
Automation of simulations; Collaboration; Data ingestion and sharing;
Integration; Knowledge discovery; Machine learning for experiments;
Machine learning for simulations; Multi-fidelity and uncertainty
quantification; Reproducibility and provenance; Scale bridging;
Simulation tools; Software infrastructure; Text mining and natural
language processing; and Visualization. We digitally recorded the
ideas in the form of "user stories" from agile software development
practices. The meeting captured many stories that would be considered
obvious, but several unexpected ideas emerged. An initial parsing
revealed three interrelated themes for the design of a useful
platform: (i) data and knowledge assets, (ii) automation of science,
and (iii) integrative approaches, as outlined in Figure 1. The ideas
related to data and knowledge assets rely on the FAIR
principles1Wilkinson M.D. Dumontier M. Aalbersberg I.J. Appleton G.

(5366) Google Scholar but with added distinguishing capabilities
relevant for a materials research platform. For example, the platform
should enable sharing and collaboration—not just around data, but also
knowledge assets such as machine-learning models or scientific
workflows. Baselines to gauge new findings are critical but often
overlooked. Artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted search and
visualization could amplify the scientific abilities of human
researchers. As part of automation of science, experimental workflows
are envisioned to be run "on-demand", where tasks are picked up by
relevant laboratories with fully or partially automated experimental
capabilities, forming collaborative networks via the platform. Given
the state-of-the-art for automation in modeling and simulation, a
similar but more "productized" automated capability with web-based
user interfaces is envisioned to assist researchers to run on-demand
simulations complementary to experiments, or train or use on-demand
machine-learning models without deep knowledge in any particular
method. Automation of scale bridging, which would entail at a minimum
designing workflows for codes beyond density functional theory (DFT)
and multi-scale application programing interfaces (APIs) for linking
the codes, emerged as a game-changing capability to bridge the gap
between the computer-design or laboratory and device level properties.
The design of integrative approaches on the platform that leverage
diverse datasets, physical, empirical, computational, or statistical
models and experiments would require a modularized software framework,
cost estimation functions, uncertainty quantification and fidelity
assessments of new data points, and subsequently, discovery "engines"
like optimal experiment design (OED), active-learning, or optimization
can be built for diverse material-device domains. Materials science of
the future is expected to be interwoven with data, automation, machine
learning, and other emerging information technologies. Many aspects of
these paradigms are being actively reviewed, debated, and discussed by
the materials community.2Alberi K. Nardelli M.B. Zakutayev A. Mitas L.

benefit from the distilled summary of ideas about the requirements of
the envisioned future system that we present in this article. The
following sections expand the concepts underlying the platform related
themes of data and knowledge assets, automation of science, and
integrative approaches for materials research. A research platform
inherits, generates, stores, and serves data and knowledge as part of
its mission. Such a platform's utility for the scientist, therefore,
is tied with how these key bits of information are assimilated and
managed; how their quality, reliability, and integrity are judged; how
their exchange and dissemination are enabled; and ultimately, whether
the informatics aspect of the platform is meeting the needs of the
scientist and helping them innovate. The requirements regarding data
management are a subset of the now well-accepted FAIR principles:
findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable.1Wilkinson M.D.

(5366) Google Scholar As a basic requirement, the platform should
contain standardized datasets. Standardization of all data imported
to, created on, and disseminated by the platform would entail adoption
of established ingestion procedures, data formats, capturing of
metadata (e.g., experimental conditions), provenance and instrument
logs, for instance to differentiate human versus machine generated
data. In addition, the platform should deliver not only well-known
computational databases, but also diverse, large, high-quality
experimental datasets, where inclusion of "dark data" (i.e., data that
is considered a "negative" result and not publishable) is essential.
Inclusion of all data is key to removing human bias from datasets.
Interaction with the data system needs to be easy and intuitive,
programmatically or via a web-based user interface (UI) that allows
easy or automated upload, instant visualization, search, and sharing
and is connected to the other components of the platform. Importance
of a simple yet powerful UI for all components of the platform
constantly came up throughout the discussions: we will not repeat that
requirement, and it should be assumed by default to be a core
component for every module hereafter. Data sharing is a core component
of today's data-driven research. The storage and sharing of analytical

to the natural course of the patient’s underlying condition or illness
but, rather, to system and process failures, many of which share
common characteristics. Organizational learning and continuous
improvements resulting from the thoughtful and systematic analysis of
such events are of vital importance in preventing their recurrence and
keeping in patients safe. Organizations and their cardiothoracic
surgical teams must determine the causes of errors and develop
solutions that address the inherent systems problems that lie at the
root of these events. When they occur, however, the causes are not
readily apparent to frontline staff because of the affective and
cognitive distortions these failures engender as well as the
complexity of the environment. Several analytic tools and methods are
available for this purpose that have been widely used in other
industries to learn from mistakes and mitigate identifiable hazards
[8Wu A.W. Lipshutz A.K. Pronovost P.J. Effectiveness and efficiency of
root cause analysis in medicine.JAMA. 2008; 299: 685-687Crossref
PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar]. Many health care systems and
regulatory agencies have embraced these methods to complement other
strategies aimed at reducing events that can be “reasonably prevented”
[9Chung K.C. Kotsis S.V. Complications in surgery: root cause analysis
and preventive measures.Plast Reconstr Surg. 2012; 129:
1421-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar]. The Joint
Commission (TJC), for example, maintains that meaningful improvements
in patient safety are dependent on each organization’s ability to
identify errors and analyze their contributing factors to prevent
similar errors from occurring again at the same institution [10The
Joint Commission Root Cause Analysis in Health Care: Tools and
Techniques.5th ed. Joint Commission Resources, Oak Brook, IL2015Google
Scholar]. Furthermore, the information learned about error frequency,
type, and root causes support continuous improvement efforts as
organizations redesign systems of care to improve outcomes and enhance
patient safety. The purpose of this paper is to highlight the utility
of event investigation and analysis to identify the causes and prevent
the occurrence of adverse events. The conceptual model for evaluating
the quality of medical care, proposed by Donabedian in 1966, contains
three components of medical care from which to derive information
regarding quality: structure, process, and outcomes [11Ayanian J.Z.
Markel H. Donabedian's lasting framework for health care quality.N
Engl J Med. 2016; 375: 205-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google
Scholar]. The structure of care involves the settings and context of
medical care delivery. Individual processes of care—the actions and
activities of delivering medical care—can be examined and compared
with best known standards of practice. The processes that can readily
be examined, however, are not always those that have the most direct
impact on outcomes. For example, the timing of preoperative antibiotic
administration can more easily be measured than the performance of a
surgeon. Although many other factors (antecedent conditions), such as
a patient’s comorbidities, influence the result of health care, it is
ultimately the outcomes that are the most important indicators of
quality [9Chung K.C. Kotsis S.V. Complications in surgery: root cause
analysis and preventive measures.Plast Reconstr Surg. 2012; 129:
1421-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar]. In this
framework, undesirable outcomes are a consequence of defects in either
the structure (ie, system design) or the incorrect application of
processes. The root causes of poor quality can be found by exploring
the gap between optimal and suboptimal results. This gap is the object
of root cause analysis (RCA) methods. Individual behavior is
influenced by an organization’s structure, set of processes, and
values [12Woods D.D. Cook R.I. Perspectives on human error: hindsight
biases and local rationality.in: Durso F.T. Nickerson R.S.
Schvaneveldt J.D. Handbook of Applied Cognition. John Wiley & Sons,
New York1999: 141-171Google Scholar]. Understanding human performance
is critical to identifying causal factors. Error-prone conditions are
usually predictable and preventable. Errors, accidents, and adverse
events can only be avoided by understanding the reasons they occur and
by applying lessons learned from similar past events. Unfortunately
and too often, human error is the conclusion of a poorly performed
accident investigation. Errors are usually a symptom of deeper
(systemic or “latent”) conditions. To understand the basic, root
causes of events, human error must be the starting point rather than
the end of an investigation to truly understand causation, systemic
hazards, and gaps in organizational performance. Organizational
learning in health care is a necessary characteristic for teams to
improve [13Carroll J.S. Edmondson A.C. Leading organizational learning
in health care.Qual Saf Health Care. 2002; 11: 51-56Crossref PubMed
Scopus (182) Google Scholar]. An organization must be skilled at
extracting “learning,” not only from major errors, but from all
available growth opportunities such as minor events, real or perceived
safety risks, near misses, and precursor events. For learning to
occur, however, organizations must also be able to systematically
aggregate and widely disseminate the results of all its
problem-solving activities. Because most adverse events rarely have a
single cause, the ability to identify a number of contributing
conditions can yield a number of possible solutions for correcting
system flaws and process failures. Identifying causal factors should
follow certain rules (Table 1) so that investigations do not fall
short of reaching true causal factors.Table 1The Five Rules of
CausationRule 1. Clearly show the “cause and effect” relationship to
each contributing factor.Rule 2. Use specific and accurate descriptors
for each action rather than vague, negative words. Avoid descriptors
such as poor, inadequate, wrong, bad, failed, careless.Rule 3. Human
errors must have a preceding cause.Rule 4. Violations of procedure are
not root causes but must have a preceding cause.Rule 5. Failure to act
is only causal when there is a preexisting duty to act.When these
rules are used, causal statements resulting from a properly conducted
root cause analysis focus on correcting actual system issues and will
increase the likelihood that those corrective actions will be
supported and sustained. (Modified from National Patient Safety

clinical environment has systems in place to monitor for potential
problems so that, when they occur, a prompt response can be mounted,
data collected, and hazards neutralized. Protocols and procedures
should be implemented to immediately respond to critical events.
Crisis management algorithms and simulation exercises with frequent
training are important components of risk management for a
safety-focused clinical team. When accidents happen, however, this
heightened predisposition to action may not lead to capturing critical
information. The use of incident reporting systems, although widely
available in hospitals and ambulatory settings, have had a poor track
record of capturing safety events due to several factors such as a
poor reporting culture, poorly designed reporting tools, inadequate
feedback to those

AB  - Introductory chaptersIn this book two lines of argumentation are
developed in relation to what agro-informaticians often describe as
'the limited adoption of Management Supporting Systems in primary
agricultural production'. Although -conceptually speaking- the
distinction is somewhat problematic, I will speak of a 'theoretical'
and a 'practical' line. Figure 1.1 in chapter I shows how these lines
of argumentation are interwoven throughout the book.Chapter I is a
general introduction to the nature and scope of this book, and
provides also some guidance to readers from different audiences.
Moreover, and anticipating my later theoretical argument, it makes
clear that I distance myself from both realist positions at the
ontological level, and from positivism at the epistemological level.
Instead, I adopt a constructivist stance, which posits that our
understanding of the world is inherently socially constructed.
Naturally, this holds for my own understanding of the world as well.
Hence, preceding more detailed accounts in relation to specific
case-studies, chapter 1 also touches on some broader social dimensions
of this research that clarify in the context of which 'negotiation
processes' this study was shaped, and which interests, projects,
feelings, etc. of the researcher were of importance.In chapter 2, 1
attempt to 'set the scene' by problematizing currently proposed
solutions to the limited adoption of Management Supporting Systems
(from now on MSS) by farmers and horticulturists. Drawing upon recent
theoretical and empirical insights, I conclude that current problem
definitions and solutions rest on inadequate unilinear models of, on
the one hand, farm development and, on the other, knowledge
generation, exchange and utilization.In my practical line of
argumentation, my elaborations lead me to identify five practical
contributions that extension science and rural development sociology
may provide to practitioners in the field of agro-informatics. Hence,
I commit myself to providing such contributions in relation to: (1)
the generation of relevant classifications of farmers and
horticulturists; (2) the development of criteria for the design of MSS
that facilitate integration of scientific and other types of
knowledge; (3) the assessment of potential contributions of extension
workers to the use and development of MSS; (4) the provision of
inductive methodologies for identifying relevant information needs;
and (5) an appraisal of the types of user-research and user-influence
that can be suitably incorporated into methods for MSS-development.In
relation to the theoretical line of argumentation, I conclude that a
theoretical framework for understanding the use and development of MSS
will have to meet two important criteria. First, it needs to allow us
to understand interactions in which MSS play a role in the
(historical) context of a complex social setting in which a variety
social actors are actively engaged. Second, it should help us to
conceptualize the social dimensions of knowledge, information,
communication and rationality, Furthermore, I propose that management
supporting systems or information technologies are best conceptualized
as computer-based communication technologies (CT).Part I: Theoretical
explorationsChapters 3, 4, 5 and 6 constitute Part I of the book. In
search of a theoretical framework that meets the above formulated
criteria, various disciplines and fields of study are explored in
chapters 3, 4 and 5.In chapter 3, it is argued that the dominant
conceptualizations; in computer science fail to meet the two criteria.
The same holds for the field of information systems research. Despite
important differences, neither the first, second or third wave
approaches of management and organization theory, nor hard, soft,
critical or autopoietic systems thinkers, provide fully satisfactory
conceptualizations. In one way or another, most approaches appear to
include elements of determinism, and fail to conceptualize actors as
active and historicallysituated agents. Similarly, even if many
approaches transcend overtly simplistic 'mechanical'
conceptualizations of information, they tend to emphasize the
subjective rather than the social dimensions of knowledge and
information. That is, due to a focus on the individual, many
approaches fail to capture the political, normative and ideological
dimensions of knowledge and information. Nevertheless, critical and
autopoietic systems thinkers especially, provide some inspiring
theoretical concepts and ideas that must somehow be incorporated into
a conceptualization of CT-use and development (these include ideas
concerning validity claims and the social nature of rationality, the
historical and recursive nature of structure, and the concepts of
thrownness, blindness and discontinuity).In chapter 4, 1 discuss
several frequently used approaches in communication science and
extension science. In essence, my elaborations lead me to draw similar
conclusions with respect to the two criteria formulated as those
arrived at in chapter 3. Even if extension scientists are increasingly
aware that extension processes need to be studied in a 'multi- actor'
context, this assessment has apparently not yet resulted in the
development of conceptualizations that are in line with it. That is,
the social dimensions of knowledge, information, communication and
rationality are insufficiently explicated, and extension scientists
often remain to have a rather passive conceptualization of human
action. In relation to this, I argue that although extension
scientists provide an interesting framework for describing different
types of anticipation problems that occur in relation to CT-use and
development, the 'diagnostic value' of such descriptions is limited as
long as an understanding of why and how such problems emerge is
lacking. Thus, I propose that there is a need to enrich both
communication science and extension science with sociological
conceptualizations of human action, communication, knowledge,
information and rationality. Hence, I reject claims made by authors
who -on the basis of a sharp distinction between 'knowledge for
action' and 'knowledge for understanding'- argue that studies aimed at
generating 'knowledge for understanding' are almost inherently of
little use to practitioners.Although it appears in chapter 5 that an
actor-oriented sociology of rural development provides promising
conceptualizations of the social actor, human action, knowledge and
ignorance, I argue that there are weaknesses as well. The approach
generates a number of important analytical concepts, but it is often
unclear how they are to be theoretically connected. Moreover, the
conceptualization of social structure leans towards 'actor
voluntarism'. Another issue is that actor-oriented sociologists have
so far insufficiently reflected on their own role in the production of
social change, so that in its present form the approach has little to
offer practitioners.In a search for more comprehensive frameworks, I
follow suggestions made by some authors in previous chapters, and
continue chapter 5 with an evaluation of the prospects of Habermas'
theory of communicative action, and Giddens' theory of structuration.
Even if Habermas' framework is becoming increasingly popular among
extension scientists, I conclude that it fails to meet the two
criteria formulated, and thus that it is unsuitable for both improving
our understanding of the use and development of CT in agriculture, and
more generally- for helping extension scientists to deal with
'multi-actor' intervention contexts. In contrast, a constructivist
interpretation of Giddens' theory seems to meet the criteria much
better. Giddens proposes that all social interaction has a
communicative dimension and that the production of meaning (and
therefore the production of knowledge and information) is inherently
connected with the operation of power and normative sanctions.
Furthermore, Giddens' theory demonstrates how actors are actively
involved in (re)producing social structure. Also, it allows me to
identify mutual knowledge (as inherently connected with mutual
ignorance) as the key modality of structure, and therefore as
underlying the existence of structural properties and the operation of
power in society. In all, I conclude that Giddens' theory offers a
much more promising and/or systematic insight into the interrelations
between action, structure, knowledge, communication and rationality
than the other sociological approaches discussed.In chapter 6, I
attempt to clear the ground for more empirical forms of investigation.
Building on the insights arrived at in the theoretical explorations, I
formulate a set of interrelated preliminary theoretical propositions
with respect to how the use and development of CT should be
understood. Most importantly, it is proposed that CT-mediated
communications must be looked at as politically and normatively laden
negotiation processes, which are inherently connected with the
(re)production of structural properties in society. The social 'codes'
incorporated into such technologies are both constraining and enabling
and can be renegotiated and creatively dealt with so that largely
unintended consequences can easily emerge. Moreover, such technologies
are best understood as playing a -never fully neutralrole in actors'
reflexive monitoring of action, rather than in processes of 'rational
decision making'.Building upon the theoretical explorations, I present
the overall 'theoretical' problem statement as:To what extent do
anticipation problems originate from: (a) the social nature of
CT-development processes, and (b) insufficient recognition of the
social dimensions of knowledge, information, communication and
rationality.At the 'practical' level we must add the question of how
an understanding of such social dimensions can help to improve the
anticipatory nature of communication technologies. Inspired by the
theoretic
