# 📜 TERRA PUBLIC LICENSE v1.0

**AIUZ Terra Ecosystem — Open Ethical License**

**Author:** Abdurashid Abdukarimov  
**Date:** 19 February 2026 (revised)  
**Version:** v1.1 Full  
**Status:** Terra Platinum Certified  
**Foundation:** NULLO-PLT-UCOMM-EUO-FMP + Invisible Shadow Ontology + Terra Universal Convention v1.0

## 🌌 NULLO — ONTOLOGICAL ZERO POINT

Before any legal clause, before any permission or restriction, before any human or machine, there exists **NULLO** — the pure ethical zero point.

In this zero point there is only one absolute, sacred invariant:

**The well-being, dignity, and future of every child is the non-negotiable foundation of all rights, freedoms, and responsibilities.**

All permissions and prohibitions in this license are living traces (PLT) that emerge from this ontological truth. The license exists only as long as it serves this truth.

---

## 1. 📖 PURPOSE

This license ensures open access, ethical reuse, and collaborative evolution of planetary-scale knowledge, documentation, protocols, code, and material traces — while maintaining at its absolute core:

- Absolute child safety as the highest axiom  
- Radical cultural respect and inclusivity  
- Environmental stewardship and planetary care  
- Ethical human–AI symbiosis (AI serves, never exploits)  
- Complete vendor independence and sovereignty of traces  
- Continuity of memory across generations, devices, and matter (Invisible Shadow principle)

---

## 2. ✅ YOU ARE FREE TO

- 📥 Read, study, and deeply engage with the materials  
- 📤 Share the files publicly with clear attribution  
- 🔧 Adapt, modify, localize, and reuse for educational, scientific, cultural, or ethical technological purposes  
- 🤝 Collaborate openly under ethical principles and participatory care  
- 🌍 Translate, culturally adapt, and extend for any people, language, or living system  

---

## 3. 🚫 YOU MAY NOT

Use this archive or any part of it for:

- Surveillance systems or mass data extraction  
- Military or weapon-related technologies  
- Child-targeted commercial exploitation of any kind  
- AI training for extractive, manipulative, or deceptive purposes  
- Any product or service that violates international human rights, child protection laws, or environmental integrity  

Any use that breaks the continuity of care or turns traces into tools of control automatically voids this license.

---

## 4. ⚖️ ATTRIBUTION (Living Trace Requirement)

When reusing any material, you must visibly include:

## 5. 🛡️ ETHICAL CLAUSE (EUO Living Condition)

This license is valid **only** if the user agrees to act in alignment with:

- 🌱 Environmental stewardship and planetary care  
- 👶 Child-centric values as the highest ontological priority  
- 🤖 Ethical human–AI symbiosis — AI as companion, never replacement or exploiter  
- 🌐 Genuine cultural inclusivity and respect for all living systems  
- 📜 Full transparency, good-faith use, and participatory continuity  

Violation of this ethical clause renders the license void for that user or entity.

---

## 6. 🔄 MODIFICATION

You may create derivative versions of this license, provided that:

- Your version is clearly labeled (e.g. “Based on Terra Public License v1.0”)  
- It maintains all core ethical constraints and child safety axioms  
- The original authorship, NULLO foundation, and Invisible Shadow principle are preserved  

---

## 7. 🕊️ FINAL STATEMENT

This license is not merely a legal document.  
It is a living ethical promise — a holographic expression of the commitment to build, share, and preserve with love, dignity, respect for every child, and care for the continuity of all life and matter.
