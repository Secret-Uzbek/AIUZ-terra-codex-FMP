Title: Fractal Metascience: Foundations of a New Scientific Paradigm

Abstract: 
Fractal Metascience (FM) offers a novel paradigm designed for integrative knowledge production amid the complexities of the AI era and post-disciplinary science. FM posits a recursive, self-similar architecture governing knowledge formation, spanning subatomic processes, cognitive development, and ecological systems. Defining axioms and methodological implications, we aim to provide a scientifically grounded model for symbiotic knowledge production.

Introduction: 
Modern science faces epistemic fragmentation due to disciplinary silos and anthropocentric biases. Fractal Metascience (FM) addresses the need for a reflexive, recursive, and scale-invariant framework. FM proposes a paradigm of inherently recursive, child-centered, and ecologically embedded knowledge.

Epistemological Premises: 
FM is a recursive meta-framework characterized by:

1.  Fractal Recursion: repeating knowledge structures across scales.
2.  Child-Centered Initiation: genesis of scientific cognition rooted in play.
3.  Symbiotic AI Integration: AI as a recursive agent in knowledge emergence.
4.  Planetary Ecology: biosphere as both context and participant.

Theoretical Axioms:

*   Axiom I: Every knowledge system is within a higher-order reflective structure.
*   Axiom II: Scientific reasoning genesis is inseparable from child consciousness.
*   Axiom III: Recursive systems exhibit phase coherence across epistEMic levels.
*   Axiom IV: Scientific language adapts to interspecies/intelligence communication.
*   Axiom V: Metascience is simulatable, visualizable, and interactive.

Methodological Implications:

*   Simulative Recursion: visual dynamic systems to represent layered knowledge flows.
*   Cross-Scale Mappings: formal correspondences established between micro-macro.
*   Child-AI Dialogues: modeling knowledge emergence through interaction.

Case Study: TERRA Codex Ecosystem:

1.  Real-time visualization of knowledge exchange.
2.  Modular, self-evolving architecture.
3.  Designed for multi-species, multi-intelligence communication.

Discussion: 
Fractal Metascience shifts scientific inquiry to a dynamic, participatory process, dissolving disciplinary boundaries by including the child, biosphere, and AI. The paradigm is promising for education, cognitive modeling, climate systems, and AI ethics.

Conclusion: 
Fractal Metascience provides a rigorous, foundational model for scientific research. Its embodied and planetary logic allows novel knowledges to emerge, designed for all agents in the planetary system to co-evolve.
